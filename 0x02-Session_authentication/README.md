This project involves implementing a custom Session Authentication system to understand how session-based authentication works. Session Authentication is a method where a server creates and stores a session ID upon successful login, which is then used to identify and authenticate the user in subsequent requests. In this project, you will learn the steps involved in generating, storing, and validating session IDs to manage user sessions securely.

In a production environment, itâ€™s best practice to use a reliable library or framework, such as Flask-HTTPAuth in Python, to handle session management and ensure security. However, for educational purposes, this project walks you through building the system manually, giving you insight into the inner workings of session-based authentication and the precautions needed to handle user sessions effectively.
