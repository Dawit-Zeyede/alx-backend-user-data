The User Authentication Service is a secure and scalable system designed to manage user registration, login, and authentication for applications. It provides essential features such as secure password storage, session management, and token-based authentication. This service ensures that user credentials are protected using industry-standard practices like hashing with bcrypt and token generation with JWT (JSON Web Tokens). It can be easily integrated into any application via a RESTful API, supporting a wide range of use cases, from web applications to mobile platforms.

This service also includes support for advanced features such as account recovery, email verification, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Developers can customize configurations for token expiration, password policies, and other security measures to suit their application's needs. Built with extensibility in mind, the service allows for future integrations with third-party authentication providers, such as Google or Facebook, to enable single sign-on (SSO). The User Authentication Service is your reliable foundation for managing user identity and securing application access.
